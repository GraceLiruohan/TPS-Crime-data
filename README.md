# TPS-Crime-data
Analyze the crime data from Toronto police service to help provide recommendations on how to better allocate their resources and reduce the overall crime rate.

This project aimed to analyze the features that impact the level of crime in Toronto to help provide TPS recommendations on how to better allocate their resources 
and ultimately reduce the overall crime rate. I built predictive models based on historical data to forecast crime hotspots (both locations and divisions), 
the number of crimes, and periods of elevated criminal activity.
